3. When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket alloca-
tions of 100 (-l 100:100,100:100), how unfair is the scheduler?
Run with some different random seeds to determine the (probabilis-
tic) answer; let unfairness be determined by how much earlier one
job finishes than the other.

    - Unfairness was about 5-6 cycles. 
4. How does your answer to the previous question change as the quan-
tum size (-q) gets larger?

    - As the time quantum increases, observed unfairness also increases. With a larger
      quantum, a job that wins the lottery runs for a longer contiguous period and can
      finish sooner, widening the gap between completion times. To improve fairness,
      choose the quantum relative to typical job lengths (e.g., smaller quanta for
      short jobs or tuned to the workload) so single wins don't let one job dominate.
