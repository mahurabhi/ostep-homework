Q4) For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround
times as FIFO?

    For any workload where the FIFO service order is already the same as the SJF order, turnaround times are identical. Common cases:

    - All jobs have equal length (every order is equivalent).  
    - The arrival sequence is nondecreasing by job length (FIFO already schedules shortest-first).  
    - Trivial cases (one job, or zero jobs).  
    - When arrival times prevent reordering so SJF cannot move a later short job ahead of an earlier long job (e.g., non‑preemptive SJF with arrivals such that FIFO = SJF).

In short: whenever the FIFO ordering coincides with the shortest‑job‑first ordering, the turnaround times match.

Q5) For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver
the same response times as RR?

    When jobs are of equal lengths and the quantum is equal to the job length. 

    When all jobs have identical service times and the RR quantum is at least as large as that job length (q >= job length, typically q = job length). 
    In that case RR hands each job its entire CPU in its first slice (no preemption), 
    SJF has no shorter jobs to reorder, and the time to first run (response time) is the same for both.

Q6) What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase?
Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

    Under SJF (non‑preemptive) the absolute response times increase as job service times increase; 
    if you scale all job lengths by a factor k, response times scale roughly by k.
    
    SJF still favors short jobs (they get very low response times); long jobs see larger increases as lengths grow.
    
    With staggered arrivals the shape can change (waiting for short arrivals can delay long jobs more), 
    but average/median response times still increase with longer service times.

Q7) What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths in-
crease? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case re-
sponse time, given N jobs?

    Response time increases along with the increase in time quantum. 

    As the RR quantum q increases, response time grows roughly linearly with q. Large q makes RR behave like FIFO (less preemption), so waiting times increase toward the sum of other jobs' service times.

    Worst‑case time to receive the first CPU slice (response time) when there are N jobs ready:
    R_max = (N − 1) * q
