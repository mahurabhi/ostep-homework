/**
 * very interesting observations with this program running on MacOS
 * 
 * Resident Size (Resident Set Size - RSS): This is the portion of a process's memory that is currently loaded and present in the computer's physical RAM. 
 * It includes both unique private memory and shared memory (like system libraries) used by the process. 
 * It indicates how much actual physical memory the application is actively using at a given moment, without including data moved to swap space.
 * Dirty Size (Dirty Memory): This refers to memory pages that have been modified since they were loaded into RAM or last written to disk. 
 * These changes mean the version in physical memory is different from the version in its backing storage (e.g., on disk). 
 * Therefore, a dirty page must be written to disk (either to its original file or to swap space) before that physical memory 
 * location can be reused by another process or for another purpose. In memory profiling tools, this often represents heap-allocated memory.
 * Swapped Size (Swapped Memory): This is the amount of a process's memory that the operating system has moved from physical RAM to a dedicated space on secondary storage 
 * (like a hard disk or SSD), known as "swap space" or a "page file". This is done to free up physical RAM for more active processes or for file system caching when the system is u
 * nder memory pressure. The data in swap space is not currently in RAM, but it can be loaded back into physical memory when needed, 
 * though accessing it from disk is much slower than accessing RAM.

swap size always seems to be 2GB. but can be dynamic on a Mac.
